# Seedbox Data Science Test

__Author:__ Ã‰mile Nadeau

This repository contains the analysis of a mock A/B testing proposed by
seedboxtech in [this repository](https://github.com/seedboxtech/datasciencetest). The
analysis instruction can be found in [instruction.md](instruction.md)

To install the required dependencies run
`pip install -r requirement.txt`

The answer to the questions can be found in [report.md](report.md) but you can
follow the analysis in more details and with the code by looking and the Jupyter
notebook worksheet [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb). This can be done by running
the command `ipython notebook analysis.ipynb`
